##### 1) 5 cities to open your first stores 

In order to create a set of 5 cities to open the first stores in I started with a [list of the 298 largest cities in the US](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population) and filtered down to the those in the 19 Midwest states specified by the [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/what-states-are-in-the-midwest/). I attempted to use these in Facebook Ads; however, I did not find the filters useful enough. Instead, I decided to look at the popularity of the words "weed", "cannabis", "marijuana", and "pot" on election day (Nov 8, 2017) across the US[^1]. The choice of election day was to identify people curious if the legalization of marijuana was on the ballot. In addition, this allowed each state could get a score. City-level data was not possible here. Then, I combined the two datasets ranked the cities based on being in a state with a high-level of popularity for the weed related terms and the largest population. Noteably, four of the top five are cities in CO where this was not a ballot question, though it was in Montana (and North Dakota - #13). 

```{r echo = FALSE}
library("rvest")
url <- "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population"
population <- 
  (url %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(xpath='//*[@id="mw-content-text"]/table[1]') %>%
  html_table())[[1]] %>%
  mutate(population = str_replace_all(`Population (2014)`, "&", "")) %>%
  separate(col = population, into = c("left", 'right'), sep = "\\.") %>%
  mutate(Population = as.integer(str_replace_all(left, ",", ''))) %>%
  select(Rank, City, State, Population) %>%
  as_tibble()

midwest_states <-
  population %>%
  inner_join(
      data_frame(
        state = state.name
        , abb = state.abb
      ) %>%
      filter(abb %in% c('PA','WV','KY','OH','IN','IL','MI','WI','IA','MO',
                        'OK','KS','CO','NE','SD','ND','MN','WY','MT'))
      , by = c("State" = "state")
  )
  
fb_bulk_upload_string <-   
  midwest_states %>%
  mutate(city_state = paste0(City, ", ", State)) %>%
  select(city_state) %>%
  unlist() %>%
  paste0(collapse = "; ")

google_trends_elections_day <- read_csv("election_day.csv", skip = 3, col_names = c("state", "value"))

midwest_states %>%
  inner_join(google_trends_elections_day, by = c("State" = "state")) %>%
  arrange(desc(value), desc(Population)) %>%
  mutate(Rank = row_number()) %>%
  select(Rank, City, State, Population, `Google Trends State Value` = value) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  pander(caption = "Order of Cities to Open Stores (incl. Top 5)")
```

##### 2) Hours your store will be opened

Google Trends only has hourly data if you look at data for the past 7 days. I did this for Washington state and Colorado (separately because it cannot be done combined). As these are two states with recreational marijuana people may search for "dispensaries near me". I wanted to find when this was most common. I used terms "dispensary" or "dispensaries" for WA[^2] and CO[^3] and plotted the two time series below. From this charts, I would have the stores open from noon to 3am each day except Sunday (early close at midnight). 

```{r echo = FALSE}
dispensaries <- 
  purrr::map(c('dispensaries_wa.csv', 'dispensaries_co.csv'), read_csv, skip = 3, 
             col_names = c("time", "dispensary","dispensaries","dispensary + dispensaries")) %>% 
    bind_rows() %>%
    cbind(state = c(rep("Washington", nrow(.)/ 2), rep("Colorado", nrow(.)/ 2))) %>%
    gather(keyword, value, -state, -time) %>%
    mutate(
        keyword = factor(keyword, levels = c("dispensary","dispensaries","dispensary + dispensaries"))
      , day = lubridate::wday(time, label = TRUE)
      , hour = lubridate::hour(time)
    ) %>%
    select(state, everything())

dispensaries %>%
  filter(keyword == "dispensary + dispensaries") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = hour, y = value, colour = state)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = hour, y = value), se = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(. ~ day) +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = 'top') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(6, 12, 18, 24)) +
  labs(y = NULL, x = "Time of Day", 
       caption = "Feb 8, 2017 9:00pm to Feb 15, 2017 7:00pm",
       colour = NULL, title = "Google Trends Popularity of 'dispensary or dispensaries'")
```


##### 3) 2 foods to sell in your store in addition to the marijuana
